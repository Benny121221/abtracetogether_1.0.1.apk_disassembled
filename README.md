All of this is courtesy of https://github.com/abtt-decompiled/abtracetogether_1.0.1.apk_disassembled, all I did was unflattened the folder structure. I would have made a fork, however my Windows git install cannot handle commits with filenames that contain backslashes (which were present in the flattened repo). And my WSL install cannot authenticate to github.com :/

The script I used to do this is also included at `abtracescript.py`
